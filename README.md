**Title**: Expoloring Emerging Business Model in Fruits and Vegetables.\\
**Description**: The traditional fresh fruit and vegetable (F and V) supply chains in India faces many structural challenges. 
The supply chain is fragmented and has multiple intermediaries-mainly independent entrepreneurs which makes the composition
of the supply chain extremely fragile wherein, if one of them fails, the supply chain does not earn money, and hence
there has to be a perfect alignment of incentives. The inefficient food supply chains result in low returns to the farmer,
higher consumer prices and limited quantity and low quality. The objective of this project is to explore emerging
business models, primarily, "Farm-to-Fork" business models, where retailers adopt alternate supply chain management
(SCM) practices to market fruits and vegetables.
